# mnasm - assembly language which seeks readability

## Idea
I heard that some people use indents and macros to enhance the readability. It hit me that an assembly with blocks and powerful macro system would be more readable.


## This is an experimental project
I find myself confused while reading assembly codes. This is why I started this project.

This project is in the stage of seeking the grammar rules, not emitting raw machine code. Therefore, right now, it emmits nasm assembly codes. Please make sure that this project is under development and has a lot of bugs.

## Expected advantages
- blocks enhance codes' readability.
- powerful macro
- etc

## Expected disadvantage
- a lot of macro definition
- etc
